# targets + crew + box

Your report: `box::use()` at the top of `_targets.R` worked with plain `tar_make()`, then broke when you added a crew controller.

## Short answer

- **Packages.** `box::use(dplyr[mutate])` at the top of `_targets.R` never reaches crew workers. A function that calls `mutate()` fails on the worker with `could not find function "mutate"`.
- `library(dplyr)` at the top **does** work on workers. targets notes it and loads dplyr again on each worker. That is why the usual targets examples work for people who use `library()`.
- **Your own modules.** `box::use(mods/helpers)` at the top, then `helpers$fn()` in the commands, **does** work on crew workers. The module object is sent to the worker. Attaching names from a module (`box::use(mods/helpers[fn])`) does **not** work.
- **Both of your ideas work** (each one tested):
  - `box::use()` inside each function works with and without crew. Two catches for **modules** (not packages):
    - The main process still needs `box.path` set (see "Second trap").
    - targets stops noticing edits to a module that is only used this way. Fix: add a file target (see below).
  - `tar_option_set(packages = "dplyr")` works for packages. It does nothing for modules. It also attaches the whole package on the worker, as `library()` does.
- **Recommended:** keep pipeline functions in box modules. Import the *module object* at the top of `_targets.R`. Call `mod$fn()` in the commands. See "What to do".
- **If you want to keep your current top-of-script style:** crew can run the same `box::use()` line on every worker when the worker starts. See "Running setup code on every crew worker". It works, but it is a workaround.
- **A second trap, even without crew.** `box::use(mods/x)` at the top of `_targets.R` fails under plain `tar_make()` unless box is told where your modules are (`options(box.path = ...)` or the `R_BOX_PATH` environment variable).
  - *Guess, not checked:* one of these was probably already set on your machine. That would explain why it worked before.
  - To check, run `getOption("box.path")` and `Sys.getenv("R_BOX_PATH")`.

## What actually happens (from the source code)

Line numbers are from the upstream dev copies. The code of these functions is the same in the installed versions (checked).

1. `tar_make()` starts a fresh R process with `callr::r()` (the default `callr_function`). It runs `_targets.R` there, in the global environment (targets `R/utils_callr.R`, `tar_callr_inner_try()`, lines 205-207).
2. **No controller:** every target runs in that same process, so everything `_targets.R` set up is there. This is why "it worked with callr".
3. **crew controller:** each target is sent to a worker. A worker is another R process, started as `Rscript --no-save --no-restore -e "crew::crew_worker(...)"` (crew `R/crew_launcher_local.R`, `launch_worker()`, lines 296-307). targets `R/class_crew.R` (`produce_exports()` and `run_worker()`, lines 92-160) sends:
   - the target itself, including its `packages` list;
   - **every object in the global environment** (`as.list(globalenv())`), as crew "globals";
   - targets' own settings (`tar_option_set()`) and its `TAR_*` environment variables.

   It does **not** send:
   - the search path (anything attached);
   - R `options()`, so not `box.path`;
   - box's cache of loaded modules.
4. On the worker:
   - crew copies the globals into the worker's global environment (crew `R/crew_eval.R`, line 127: `list2env(globals, globalenv())`).
   - targets loads the target's `packages` with `require()` (targets `R/class_build.R`, line 64, and `R/utils_packages.R`, `load_packages()`).
   - Then the command runs.
5. Where box puts things (box `R/env.r`, `find_import_env()`, lines 204-213; box `R/use.r`, `assign_alias()`, lines 525-532):
   - `box::use(dplyr[mutate])` or `box::use(mods/x[fn])` at top level: box attaches a new environment named `mod:dplyr` to the **search path** (like `attach()`). It is not in the global environment, so targets does not send it.
   - `box::use(mods/x)` or `box::use(dplyr)`: box creates an object (`x`, `dplyr`) **in the global environment**, so targets sends it. The module's own `box::use()` imports live inside it and go with it.
   - `box::use()` inside a function: the names are visible only inside that function call. This works in any R process that has box installed (modules also need the module path, see below).
6. Why `library(dplyr)` works:
   - `tar_target(packages =)` defaults to `tar_option_get("packages")`.
   - That defaults to `(.packages())`: the packages attached **at the moment `tar_target()` is called** (targets `R/class_options.R`, line 288).
   - So a `library()` call above your target list silently adds `dplyr` to every target's `packages`.
   - box never attaches `package:dplyr`, so `.packages()` does not list it and nothing is loaded on the worker.

What a target sees. Taken from `targets/mechanism_view`, whose `_targets.R` has `box::use(dplyr[mutate])`, `box::use(mods/tfuns)` and a function `add_x` at the top:

| where the target ran | global objects it sees | `mod:dplyr` on the search path? |
|---|---|---|
| main process (no controller) | `add_x`, `tfuns` (+ 2 leftover callr objects) | yes |
| crew worker | `add_x`, `tfuns` (+ the same 2) | **no** |

## Second trap: box cannot find modules from `_targets.R` (even without crew)

- callr runs R as `R -f /tmp/RtmpXXXX/callr-scr-...`. box guesses "the script's folder" from that `-f` argument (box `R/paths.r`, `r_path()`, line 124). So it looks for modules in the **temp folder**, not in your project.
- As a result, `box::use(mods/tfuns)` or `box::use(./mods/tfuns)` at the top of `_targets.R` fails under plain `tar_make()`, with: `unable to load module "mods/tfuns"; not found in ".../box/mod", "/tmp/RtmpgjW5LJ"`. It works with `tar_make(callr_function = NULL)` run from `Rscript -e`.
- crew workers are started with `Rscript -e`, which names no script file. So box falls back to the working directory. Local workers start in the project folder (tested).
- So the **opposite** happens for modules loaded inside functions: on a local crew worker they are found, but in the main callr process they are not (variant `mod_in_fn`).
- Fix for the main process: put `options(box.path = getwd())` at the top of `_targets.R` (or in the project `.Rprofile`). `box::set_script_path(file.path(getwd(), "_targets.R"))` also works.
- **Watch out: `R_BOX_PATH` beats `box.path`.** If the environment variable `R_BOX_PATH` is set, box ignores `options(box.path)` completely (box `R/paths.r`, `mod_search_path()`, lines 247-254).
  - Tested: `options(box.path = getwd())` plus `Sys.setenv(R_BOX_PATH = "<team lib>")`, then `box::use(mods/tfuns)`. This fails: box only looks in the team lib, box's own folder and `/tmp/Rtmp...`.
  - If IT or your `.Renviron` already sets `R_BOX_PATH`, `options(box.path = ...)` does nothing.
- `options(box.path = ...)` is **not** sent to workers. This only matters if your modules live **outside** the project folder (for example, a team library). In that case, either:
  - put **all** module folders in `R_BOX_PATH` at the top of `_targets.R`. Local workers inherit environment variables. Tested:

    ```r
    Sys.setenv(R_BOX_PATH = paste(getwd(), "/path/to/team/lib", sep = .Platform$path.sep))
    ```

  - or set `box.path` in the project `.Rprofile`. Workers read it, because crew starts them without `--vanilla`.
  - box's docs say a future major version will read `R_BOX_PATH` only once, when box loads (box `R/use.r`, lines 135-138). So set it at the very top, before any `box::use()`.
- Known upstream: klmr/box#199 "Callr module sourcing" (open since 2021). The person who reported it hit this with targets and used `callr_function = NULL` as a workaround.

## Running setup code on every crew worker

- crew 1.3.3 has no option made for this. `crew_controller_local()` has no setup or startup argument. targets has none either: `tar_hook_before()` only wraps each target's command.
- But crew starts each local worker as `Rscript <r_arguments> -e "crew::crew_worker(...)"`. Any extra `-e` code you put in `r_arguments` runs first, once per worker. Tested (`pkg_box_top_rargs`, `mod_attach_top_rargs`):

  ```r
  library(targets)
  box::use(dplyr[mutate])                     # main process, as before
  worker_setup <- "box::use(dplyr[mutate])"   # the same line, as text, for each crew worker
  tar_option_set(controller = crew::crew_controller_local(
    workers = 2, r_arguments = c("--no-save", "--no-restore", "-e", worker_setup)
  ))
  ```

- For modules, put the module path in the same text, for example `sprintf("options(box.path = %s); box::use(mods/tfuns[add_x])", deparse(getwd()))`.
- Catches:
  - crew's documentation only shows command-line flags here (such as `--vanilla`). Passing code is an unofficial use and could break in a future crew.
  - You must keep the two lines the same by hand.
  - targets still does not notice edits to module functions attached this way.
  - Tested only with local workers on Linux. Not tested on Windows (quoting) or with crew.cluster.

## Results (each variant is a small project in `targets/<variant>/`; `Rscript 04-targets.R` reruns all of them, about 5 min)

How to read the tables:
- `none` = plain `tar_make()`. `crew` = `crew_controller_local(workers = 2)`.
- "2nd run" = how many targets a second `tar_make()` re-ran. 0 is correct.
- "edit noticed" = I changed `var1 * 2` to `var1 * 3` in the module or function file. Does `tar_outdated()` then list `out`?

Packages (a function defined in `_targets.R` calls `mutate()`):

| `pkg_custom_envir` | box + fn inside `local(envir = e, ...)`, then `tar_option_set(envir = e)` | works | works (box puts the imports in a parent of `e`, and targets sends `e` whole) |
| `pkg_box_top_imports`, `pkg_imports_qualified` | `tar_option_set(imports = "dplyr")` | FAILS: `igraph::is_dag(graph) is not TRUE` | FAILS (same) |

Side findings:
- **`tar_option_set(imports = ...)` does not load anything.** It only makes targets *track* a package's functions. With dplyr it breaks the whole pipeline. dplyr has internal functions that call each other in a loop: I found two pairs, `expand_pick_call`/`expand_pick_quo` and `dplyr_order_legacy`/`dplyr_proxy_order_legacy`. targets requires the graph of imported functions to have no loops (targets `R/utils_imports.R`, line 26: `stopifnot(igraph::is_dag(graph))`).
- **Module objects are tracked, but as one block.** targets saves a fingerprint (hash) of a top-level module object, like any other global. The fingerprint stays the same between sessions: a second run re-ran 0 targets.
  - An edit **anywhere** in the module re-runs **every** target that uses that module. Tested: I edited only `add_x`, and both `clean$add_x()` and `clean$add_y()` targets became outdated.
  - Functions loaded with `tar_source()` are tracked one by one. With the same edit, only the `add_x` target became outdated.
- **Cost of `box::use()` inside a function, per call:** about 3.8 ms for `dplyr[mutate]` and about 0.6 ms for an already-loaded module. `dplyr::mutate` takes under 1 microsecond. This does not matter once per target. It adds up inside a loop: 10,000 calls is about 40 s.
- **Packages stay attached on crew workers between tasks.** `crew_controller_local()` defaults to `reset_packages = FALSE` (and `reset_options = FALSE`). Tested with one worker: after one task ran `library(dplyr)`, a later task found `mutate`. So a `library()` call inside one target can make a later target on the same worker work by accident. (`box::use()` inside a command did not leave anything behind.)
- **Testing these pipelines inside testthat hides the callr trap.** testthat sets `TESTTHAT=true`, and then box looks for modules in `getwd()` (box `R/paths.r`, `testthat_path()`, line 175). `tests/testthat/test-targets.R` turns this off for the R processes it starts.

## What to do (ranked; each tested above)

1. **Put functions in box modules, and import the module object at the top of `_targets.R`** (`mod_alias_top`; this exact file was also run with crew).

   ```r
   # _targets.R
   library(targets)
   tar_option_set(controller = crew::crew_controller_local(workers = 2))
   options(box.path = getwd())   # so the callr process that tar_make() starts finds mods/
   box::use(mods/clean)          # mods/clean.R itself starts with box::use(dplyr[mutate])
   list(
     tar_target(raw, data.frame(var1 = 1:3)),   # your real data step here
     tar_target(out, clean$add_x(raw))
   )
   ```

   - Pros:
     - works with and without crew;
     - the module's imports go with it;
     - no `library()`;
     - targets notices module edits.
   - Cons:
     - It needs the `box.path` line. If `R_BOX_PATH` is set on your machine, put the project folder in `R_BOX_PATH` instead.
     - Any edit to a module re-runs every target that uses that module. Smaller modules mean fewer re-runs.
     - Do not call `mod$fn()` on a *column* inside a dbplyr verb: that is the silent-wrong-result trap ([01-nse.md](01-nse.md#silent-wrong-result)). Call module functions on the whole table, as above.
2. **`box::use()` inside each function** (`pkg_box_in_fn`, `mod_in_fn_boxpath`). box's README shows this style: imports stay local to the function.
   - Pros: works in any process (main, callr, crew). It does not depend on what targets sends.
   - Cons:
     - For **modules**, targets no longer notices edits, because the function body does not change. Fix: add `tar_target(clean_file, "mods/clean.R", format = "file")` and mention `clean_file` in the command (`mod_in_fn_tracked`).
     - Module lookups still need `box.path` (or `R_BOX_PATH`) in the main process.
     - There is a small cost per call (see above).
3. **`tar_option_set(packages = c("dplyr", ...))` for packages only**, combined with 1 or 2 for your modules (`pkg_packages_opt`).
   - Pros: one line, and it is the standard targets way. Packages are loaded before each target on every worker.
   - Cons: it attaches whole packages on the worker (like `library()`, so names can mask each other), which is what box is meant to avoid. It does nothing for modules.
4. **Last resorts** (they work, but each has a catch):
   - Run your top-of-script `box::use()` line on every worker through `r_arguments` (see "Running setup code on every crew worker"). Unofficial use of crew; the two lines must be kept the same; edits to attached module functions are not noticed.
   - `deployment = "main"` on a target runs it in the main process, so that target gets no parallel speed-up.
   - A project `.Rprofile` with `box::use(...)` runs in every R session started in that folder, including yours. The setup is hidden.
   - `R_BOX_PATH` for a module library outside the project works on local workers. List the project folder in it too. Cluster workers (crew.cluster) were not tested.
5. **Do not rely on these:**
   - `box::use(pkg[fn])` or `box::use(mods/x[fn])` at the top on its own: attached names stay in the main process.
   - `tar_source()` of files that start with `box::use()`: same problem.
   - `tar_hook_before()`: it only fixes code written directly in the command, not code inside functions.
   - `tar_option_set(imports =)`: it is not about loading, and it breaks with dplyr.
   - `options(box.path)` alone, for modules outside the project.
   - `options(box.path)` and `R_BOX_PATH` together: `R_BOX_PATH` wins and the option is ignored.

Rerun: `Rscript 04-targets.R` writes `results/04-targets.csv` and regenerates `targets/<variant>/` (about 5 min). Fast tests: `testthat::test_file("tests/testthat/test-targets.R")` (6 checks, about 3 s). Add `RUN_TARGETS_TESTS=true` to also run the real pipelines (15 checks, about 55 s). Tested with targets 1.12.0, tarchetypes 0.14.1, crew 1.3.3, mirai 2.7.3, box 1.2.3, callr 3.8.0. Only local crew workers on Linux were tested.
